        Q1 : {BT1-041 Beerus, General of Demolition}’s skill caused the opponent to place the only card in their hand into the Drop Area. Does the “if they don’t” part of the skill resolve?<br/><br/>
        A1 : Yes, it does. The skill resolves in any situation where the opponent can’t place 2 cards from their hand into the Drop Area.<br/><br/>
        Q2 : When {BT1-041 Beerus, General of Demolition} attacks the opponent’s Leader Card, the opponent activates [Blocker], redirecting the target of the attack to that card. In this case, does {BT1-041 Beerus, General of Demolition}’s auto skill activate?
        <br/>
        A2 : Yes, it does.
        {BT1-041 Beerus, General of Demolition}’s auto skill has already activated by the time the opponent can choose to activate [Blocker]. The skill resolves before the [Blocker] skill does.

        Q1 : What does {BT1-043 Whis, Judge of the Gods}’s auto skill “after your current turn ends, take another turn” mean?<br/>
        A1 : The opponent does not start their turn after you end your turn. You get to play a full extra turn - from Charge Phase to End Phase - instead.<br/><br/>
        Q2 : Can {BT1-043 Whis, Judge of the Gods} attack even when there are active effects that prevent Battle Cards from attacking? 
        <br/>
        A2 : No, it cannot.
        “Battle Cards cannot attack” and similar effects don’t negate attacks; they simply prevent Battle Cards from attacking at all.

        When your opponent activates and pays the cost for [Over Realm], you can activate [Counter: Play] before they send their Drop Area to the Warp, or after your opponent plays the card via [Over Realm].

        Q9 : When can you activate {BT1-107 Cold Bloodlust} against [Activate: Main] skills on cards like {BT2-043 Trunks, Creator of the Future}?<br/>
        A9 : [Counter: Play] skills can be activated before and/or after the opponent resolves the skill that puts the Battle Card into play.
        When your opponent activates and pays for {BT2-043 Trunks, Creator of the Future}’s [Activate: Main] skill, [Counter: Play] can be activated before they choose a card from their hand to put into play, or after your opponent chooses the card from their hand and puts it into play.

        Q10 : When can you activate a [Counter] against your opponent’s [Counter]?<br/>
        A10 : You can only activate it after your opponent activates their own [Counter] but before it resolves.
        [Counter] skills are activated and resolved during a special timing window called counter timing, but it ends as soon as one [Counter] skill begins to resolve. Once counter timing ends, [Counter] skills can no longer be activated, which means that new [Counter] skills can’t be activated once a [Counter] finishes resolving.<br/>

        A11 : Yes, they are.
        {BT1-043 Whis, Judge of the Gods}’s skill stopping its attacks and skills from being negated is applied when the card is in the Battle Area, but {BT1-107 Cold Bloodlust} negates its skills before the card is played.

        Q12 : {BT1-107 Cold Bloodlust} is activated in response to {BT2-037 Determined Striker SSB Son Goku}’s [Counter: Attack] skill. Can {Determined Striker SSB Son Goku}’s [Counter: Attack] skill still be used to negate the attack?<br/>
        A12 : Yes, {BT2-037 Determined Striker SSB Son Goku}’s [Counter: Attack] skill can still be used to negate the attack.
        {BT1-107 Cold Bloodlust} negates {BT2-037 Determined Striker SSB Son Goku}’s skills for the duration of the turn, but skills that have already been activated still resolve.<br/>
        Q13 : Why can Cold Bloodlust negate {TB1-097 Son Goku, The Awakened Power}'s [Victory Strike]?<br/>
        A13 :  When {BT1-107 Cold Bloodlust} or {XD1-10 Frost's Deadly Poison} is activated during the first counter window, it can negate a Battle Card’s skills in the area it is in before it is played.
        Cards like {BT1-043 Whis, Judge of the Gods} and {TB1-097 Son Goku, The Awakened Power} have skills that say “[Permanent] This card's attack and skill cannot be negated,” but those skills are only active when those cards are in the Battle Area. Cards like {DB1-021 Ultra Instinct Son Goku, the Unstoppable} have skills that say “[Permanent] This card's skills can't be negated in any area by your opponent's skills.”, and those skills are always active, no matter what area the card is in, so they can’t be negated by a card like {Cold Bloodlust}.
