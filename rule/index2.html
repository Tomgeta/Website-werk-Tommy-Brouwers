                        A1 : No, you cannot.You must draw a card.<br/><br/>
            
                        Q2 : When one of your Battle Cards with power less than 15000 attacks for the first time, does the auto skill of {BT1-001 Champa} activate?<br/>
                        A2 : Yes, it does.However, you cannot draw a card off of it.<br/><br/>
                        Q3 : The auto skills of {BT1-001 Champa} and {BT1-014 Saiyan Cabba} activated simultaneously. In this case, can you draw a card off {BT1-001 Champa}’s auto skill?
                        A3 : When two or more of your auto skills activate simultaneously, you can resolve them in any order you choose.<br/>
                        If you resolve {BT1-014 Saiyan Cabba}’s skill first, the card’s power will exceed 15000, so you can draw a card with {BT1-001 Champa}.<br/>
                        If you resolve {BT1-001 Champa}’s skill first, the power of {BT1-014 Saiyan Cabba} is still 5000, so you cannot draw a card.

                          A1 : No, you cannot. Resolve the skill as quickly as possible, and do not look at other cards unless absolutely necessary.<br/><br/>

                          Q2 : When one of your Battle Cards with power less than 15000 attacks for the first time, does the auto skill of {BT1-001 Champa} activate?<br/>
                          A2 : Yes, it does.However, you cannot draw a card off of it.<br/><br/>
                          Q3 : The auto skills of {BT1-001 Champa} and {BT1-014 Saiyan Cabba} activated simultaneously. In this case, can you draw a card off {BT1-001 Champa}’s auto skill?
                          A3 : When two or more of your auto skills activate simultaneously, you can resolve them in any order you choose.<br/>
                          If you resolve {BT1-014 Saiyan Cabba}’s skill first, the card’s power will exceed 15000, so you can draw a card with {BT1-001 Champa}.<br/>
                          If you resolve {BT1-001 Champa}’s skill first, the power of {BT1-014 Saiyan Cabba} is still 5000, so you cannot draw a card.

                    A1 : No, you cannot. Resolve the skill as quickly as possible, and do not look at other cards unless absolutely necessary.<br/><br/>
                    Q2 : When looking at a specified number of cards from the top of your deck, do you need to declare the number of cards beforehand?

                  If you resolve {BT1-014 Saiyan Cabba}’s skill first, the card’s power will exceed 15000, so you can draw a card with {BT1-001 Champa}.<br/>
                  If you resolve {BT1-001 Champa}’s skill first, the power of {BT1-014 Saiyan Cabba} is still 5000, so you cannot draw a card.
